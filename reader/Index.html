        Machine vision is the ability of a computer to see; it employs one or more video cameras, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and digital signal processing (DSP). The resulting data goes to a computer or robot controller. Machine vision is similar in complexity to voice recognition. Machine vision is sometimes conflated with the term computer vision. The technology is often integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning to accelerate image processing.

        Machine vision uses cameras to capture visual information from the surrounding environment. It then processes the images using a combination of hardware and software and prepares the information for use in various applications. Machine vision technology often uses specialized optics to acquire images. This approach lets certain characteristics of the image be processed, analyzed and measured. Machine vision, paired with AI and deep learning, expands the role of robots in performing production-line tasks, such as picking, sorting, placing and performing a manufacturing line scan. This combination of technologies also enables robotics to operate in other environments, such as supermarkets, hospitals and restaurants.

        Machine vision uses cameras to capture visual information from the surrounding environment. It then processes the images using a combination of hardware and software and prepares the information for use in various applications. Machine vision technology often uses specialized optics to acquire images. This approach lets certain characteristics of the image be processed, analyzed and measured.

        For example, a machine vision application as part of a manufacturing system can be used to analyze a certain characteristic of a part being manufactured on an assembly line. It could determine if the part meets quality criteria and, if not, dispose of the part.

In manufacturing settings, machine vision systems typically need the following:

 Lighting. Lighting illuminates the object or scene to make its features visible.
 Lens. This captures the image and delivers it to the sensor in the camera as light.
Capture board, frame grabber or sensor. These devices work together to process the image from the camera and convert it to a digital format as pixels. Image sensors convert light into electric signals using either complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology or a charge-coupled device.
 Processor. The processor runs software and related algorithms that process the digital image and extracts the required information.
 Communication. These systems enable the machine vision cameras and processing system to communicate with other elements of the bigger system, usually using a discrete input/output signal or a serial connection.
