        Machine vision is the ability of a computer to see; it employs one or more video cameras, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and digital signal processing (DSP). The resulting data goes to a computer or robot controller. Machine vision is similar in complexity to voice recognition. Machine vision is sometimes conflated with the term computer vision. The technology is often integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning to accelerate image processing.

        Machine vision uses cameras to capture visual information from the surrounding environment. It then processes the images using a combination of hardware and software and prepares the information for use in various applications. Machine vision technology often uses specialized optics to acquire images. This approach lets certain characteristics of the image be processed, analyzed and measured. Machine vision, paired with AI and deep learning, expands the role of robots in performing production-line tasks, such as picking, sorting, placing and performing a manufacturing line scan. This combination of technologies also enables robotics to operate in other environments, such as supermarkets, hospitals and restaurants.
